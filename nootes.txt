----Framework vs Library

*)Framework is complete environment and has to follow its 
architecture ,no modification allowed in framework as 
architecture is set once
*)example of framework is angular ,next
*)react is library which is smaller than framework

*)framework is enough for complete development solution

*)library is not enough for complete project

*)different libraries needed to be use together for 
achieving complete solution

*)bootstrap is not enough for complete project

*)nextjs is enough for completing a functional project

----- React -------
--intro

*)it is not seo friendly 
*)routing needed to be installed with react
*)solution is next js
*) pre requisite of nextjs is javascript and react

--terminologies

*)components is piece of code like header button and are reuseable
*)jsx (jsvsdcript xmale)



*)react is difficult to start with so another library helps in 
starting react project called CRA(Create React App)

--example
*)command is as follows myproject can be relaced with your own projectname	
  
 npx create-react-app myproject


--build

*)browser understand only javascript so react code is converted 
to html css and js through build

--npm
*)node pakage manager(comes with node js)
*)its a vast directory of node pakages
---npx

*)node package eXecute 
*)it is a npm pakage runner
*)npx allows to use node pakage available in NPM registry
 without installling them

----staring react project

*)starting project command is as follows

  npm start

*)note that start is name of actual command and is present in 
pakage.json file,so you can change its name but you would need to 
use run as start is default keyname and run is not needed ther
*)example of it is:

  npm run dev

*)dev is the name we replace with start in pakage.json file



*)



-----yarn

*)yarn is another pakage manager but not npm
*)performance os yarn is better than npm
*)installing yarn command is as follows:

	npm i -g yarn

*)this command will globally install yarn in our project

*)to check yarn version command is as follows

    yarn --version

 
*)you can start porject with yarn as well


---JSX

*)has .jsx extention
*)allowed html shortcuts like h2 enter 
and both opening andclosing tags created
*)if you wan to write javascript in react then curly brakets
 {} are must
*)donot allow self closing tags to be open like <br> not allowed
instead <br/> is accepted
*)passing style in html through style tag is not allowed like:
--Xxx <h2 style = "colour:red;border:2px solid red">hello</h2> --XXX

--CSS

*)Importinf app.css is necessary in app.jsx file as no css 
link in head tag
*)you can add inline css as well with props
*)inline css is not a good practice

--prop

*)in react attributes are defined with props
*)style attribute take object
*)inside that oject you need another object as want to write 
javascript there
*)props also require curly brackets {}
*)you specify css property in style prop through camelCase 
and propertyvalue in string as you use in javascript
*)example is:

<h2 style = {{backgroundColor:"red"}} >Hello World</h1>


*)can add multiple properties through comma seprated

---class

*)instead of writing classes in "class" attribute you need
 to use "className"

--image

*)you will always import images before using them unlike acessing 
everywhere in javascript through directory structure or path
*) for images comes from addresses like internet url

--v2-image

*)for downloaded images "React:image V2" commit explains
*)its better to make assests folder and images folder in src folder
and save downloaded image there
